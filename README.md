# Interface (IO server + dashboard) - Diving Simulator

Special thanks to MINES - PSL and its research laboratory CRC for having proposed us to realize this project for the benefit of the Hospitals of Nice.

This interface is entirely realized in Javascript, from the frontend to the backend. It is made to work with the Diving Simulator developed on Unity by Marguerite DEJEAN DE LA BATIE, Anatole HERNOT (@ahernot), Fran√ßois MAZE (@francoismaze) and me. Please give a look on the following repository : <https://github.com/ahernot/diving-simulator>

## Backend: NodeJS - Express - SocketIO (master)

## Frontend : ReactJS - Bootstrap
